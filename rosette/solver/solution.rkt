(provide solution? sat? unsat? sat unsat model core)

; Represents the solution to a set of logical constraints.  The solution 
; has single field, result, which stores either a model of the constraints, 
; an unsatisfiable core, or #f. 
; 
; If the constraints are satisfiable, the result is dictionary binding symbolic 
; constants to values. In that case, the solution 
; can be used as a procedure, which takes as input a symbolic constant and 
; returns a concrete value for that constant, if any, or the constant itself, if the 
; model has no binding for that constant.
; 
; If the constraints are unsatisfiable, and no core has been extracted, the result field is #f.
; If a core has been extracted, the result is a list of constraints (that is @boolean? terms or 
; values) that do not have a model.
